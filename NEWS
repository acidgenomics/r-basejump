## basejump 0.7.1 (2018-08-18)

### New functions

- `cleanSystemLibrary()`: Utility function to check whether a user has installed
  packages into the [R][] system library. Refer to `.libPaths()` documentation
  for more information on library paths.

### Major changes

- Now using `build` instead of `genomeBuild` for [Ensembl][] annotation
  functions. The `genomeBuild` argument still works but now will inform the user
  about the change.

### Minor changes

- Migrated `prepareTemplate()` from [bcbioBase][] package. Simplifed this
  function to copy all files inside `extdata/rmarkdown/shared` within a
  specified package. Currently in use for [bcbioRNASeq][], [bcbioSingleCell][],
  and the new [pointillism][] clustering package.
- Made [Ensembl][] release matching stricter, based on the metadata columns.


## basejump 0.7.0 (2018-08-07)

In this release, we are migrating some of the S4 generics previously exported
in the [bcbioBase][] package. We are consolidating these functions here for
simplicity and stability.

### New functions

- `makeSummarizedExperiment()`: Renamed `prepareSummarizedExperiment()`,
  previously exported in the [bcbioBase][] package. We are using the `make`
  prefix here for consistency (see other gene annotation functions).
- Migrated S4 generics and methods from [bcbioBase][]: `flatFiles()`,
  `metrics()`, `plotCorrleationHeatmap()`, `plotGene()`, `plotHeatmap()`,
  `plotQC()`, and `plotQuantileHeatmap()`.

### Major changes

- Now using `curl::has_internet()` internally to check for Internet connection.
  This applies to the annotation functions that query web databases.
- Added coercion method support for converting a `SummarizedExperiment` to
  an unstructured `list`. This is the method used internally for `flatFiles()`.


## basejump 0.6.4 (2018-08-03)

### New functions

- `matchInterestingGroups()`: New developer function to automatically handle
  `interestingGroups` argument used across various plotting functions and in the
  [bcbio][] infrastructure packges.


## basejump 0.6.3 (2018-08-01)

### Minor changes

- Migrated `separatorBar` and `updateMessage` global export from [bcbioBase][].
  Improved `separatorBar` appeareance to automatically scale to current session
  width, using `getOption("width")`.


## basejump 0.6.2 (2018-07-31)

### New functions

- `convertSymbolsToGenes()`: provides `SummarizedExperiment` method support for
  converting objects containing gene symbols ("geneName") as rownames back to
  gene identifiers ("geneID").
- `eggnog()`: quickly download current annotations from [EggNOG][] database.
  Useful for annotating gene-to-protein matches; currently in use with the
  [brightworm][] RNAi screening package, which contains [WormBase][] gene ID and
  [EggNOG][] ID annotations.

### Major changes

- Now suggesting [BiocManager][] instead of [BiocInstaller][] for installation.
- `broadClass()` now supports `GRanges` and `SummarizedExperiment`. Support for
  `data.frame` and/or `DataFrame` class objects has been removed.

### Minor changes

- `convertGenesToSymbols()` and `convertTranscriptsToGenes()` now have
  `organism` and `gene2symbol` arguments set `NULL` by default.
- Upgraded to [roxygen2][] v6.1 for documentation, which improves handling of
  aliases in the Rd manual files.
- Added `dplyr::pull()` to reexported functions.
- Improved package documentation by declaring the supported class(es) for
  each function argument.
- Moved `foldChangeToLogRatio()` and `logRatioToFoldChange()` constructors into
  `numeric` method declarations.
- Simplified internal code for `gene2symbol()` `SummarizedExperiment` method.
- `toStringUnique()` now uses `x` instead of `atomic` as primary argument.


## basejump 0.6.1 (2018-07-21)

### Minor changes

- Bug fix for `convertGenesToSymbols()` method for `SummarizedExperiment`.
  Previously, if `geneName` column was a factor, this function would error.
  This issue has been fixed by ensuring that the symbols provided in `geneName`
  are coerced to a character vector.
- Improved [conda][] installation instructions.


## basejump 0.6.0 (2018-07-17)

### Major changes

- Now importing [SummarizedExperiment][] package and providing basic method
  support for generics that were previously used in the [bcbioBase][] package.
- Improved GFFv3 handling in `makeGRangesFromGFF()` and other GFF utility
  functions, including `makeGene2symbolFromGFF()` and `makeTx2geneFromGFF()`.
  Note that `makeGRangesFromGFF()` now returns additional metadata columns
  accessible with `S4Vectors::mcols()`, and that these columns are now sorted
  alphabetically.

### Migrated functions

Previously, these functions were exported in the [bcbioBase][] package, but
they provide non-[bcbio][]-specific functionality, and should be included here
in the [basejump][] package instead:

- `assertFormalInterestingGroups()`.
- `gene2symbol()`.
- `interestingGroups()`, `uniteInterestingGroups()`.
- `sampleData()`, `sanitizeSampleData()`.
- `sampleNames()`.
- `selectSamples()`.

Providing basic `SummarizedExperiment` class method support for `counts()`.

### Minor changes

- `geometricMean()` generic was not exported correctly.


## basejump 0.5.11 (2018-07-09)

### Minor changes

- Now requiring [ggplot2][] v3.0 internally.
- `theme_midnight()` and `theme_paperwhite()` now extend
  `ggplot2::theme_linedraw()`, improving the consistency between these themes.
- Example data is now consistenly formatted using snake case: `rnaseq_counts`
  and `single_cell_counts`, instead of the previous camel case conventions:
  `rnaseqCounts`, `singleCellCounts`.
- Camel variants of the ggplot themes are now deprecated.
- Updated internal gene synonyms data from [NIH][].


## basejump 0.5.10 (2018-06-28)

### Minor changes

- Removed `makeNames` argument from `readFileByExtension()` function. Use the
  `makeNames` family of functions manually after data import instead. This
  helps avoid unwanted sanitization of data.
- Simplified assert checks for internal load function.
- Improved code coverage.
- [AppVeyor CI][] updates to work with [Bioconductor][] 3.8 devel.


## basejump 0.5.9 (2018-06-12)

### Minor changes

- Markdown function consistency improvements. Now all relevant [Markdown][]
  functions use `text` as the primary argument, instead of `object`.


## basejump 0.5.8 (2018-06-05)

### Minor changes

- `makeGRangesFromEnsembl()` now supports remapping of [UCSC][] genome build to
  Ensembl. However, this isn't recommended, and will warn the user.
- `convertUCSCBuildToEnsembl()` now returns `NULL` instead of erroring on
  genome build match failure.
- `stripTranscriptVersions()` now matches "`.`", "`-`", and "`_`" version
  delimiters.
- Made unused `dynamicPlotlist()` function defunct.
- Consider deprecating `assertIsCharacterOrNULL()` and
  `assertIsDataFrameOrNULL()` in a future release.

### Infrastructure changes

- Reenable [Travis CI][] blocklist, excluding develop branch from checks.
- Reorganized documentation of deprecated and defunct functions.


## basejump 0.5.7 (2018-05-24)

### Minor changes

- Tweaked gray color accents for `theme_midnight()` and `theme_paperwhite()`.


## basejump 0.5.6 (2018-05-19)

### Minor changes

- Fixed NAMESPACE issue with `GenomeInfoDb::seqnames()`.
- Improved `readGFF()` working example to reflect switch to `GRanges` return.
- Added [macOS][] bioc-release image to [Travis CI][] build checks.


## basejump 0.5.5 (2018-05-15)

### Major changes

- `readGFF()` now uses `rtracklayer::import()` internally to return GFF file
  as a `GRanges` object instead of a `data.frame`.

### Minor changes

- `assertIsGFF()` and `parseGFFAttributes()` functions are now defunct.
- Simplified internal GFF handling code for `makeGRangesFromGFF()`,
  `makeGene2symbolFromGFF()`, and `makeTx2geneFromGFF()`.


## basejump 0.5.4 (2018-05-08)

- Migrated `sanitizeSampleData()` to [bcbioBase][] package.
- Updated [Bioconductor][] install method for 3.7.


## basejump 0.5.3 (2018-04-30)

### Minor changes

- Improved internal S4 method code for `fixNA()` and `removeNA()`.
- Tweaked gray accent colors in `theme_midnight()` and `theme_paperwhite()`.
  Now using British spelling internally for ggplot code.
- Improved `strip.background` for `theme_paperwhite()`, removing the black box
  around the labels when facet wrapping is enabled.


## basejump 0.5.2 (2018-04-26)

### Minor changes

- Improved documentation for assert check functions.
- Deprecated `geomean()` in favor of `geometricMean()`.
- Simplified internal code for `grepString()`.
- Added message during `hgnc2gene()` call.
- Miscellaneous documentation fixes.
- Moved internal constructors into the S4 method definitions, where applicable.
- Simplified default parameter definition for `panther(organism = "XXX")`.
- Improved code coverage, using `nocov` where appropriate.


## basejump 0.5.1 (2018-04-16)

### Minor changes

- `emptyRanges()`: Now using `match.arg()` internally to capture `seqname`
  argument.
- Removed legacy `.assignCamelArgs()` and `.assignCamelFormals()` internal
  functions.
- Improved internal handling of XLSX files in `localOrRemoteFile()`.


## basejump 0.5.0 (2018-04-13)

### New functions

- `emptyRanges()` enables easy creation of placeholder ranges for `GRanges`
  objects, where transgene and FASTA spike-ins are needed.
- `hgnc2gene()` enables easy mapping of [HGNC][] to [Ensembl][] gene
  identifiers.
- `mgi2gene()` enables easy mapping of [MGI][] to [Ensembl][] gene identifiers.
- `panther()` function enables easy querying of the [PANTHER][] website.
  Human, mouse, nematode worm, and fruit fly are currently supported. The
  specific [PANTHER][] release (e.g. 13) can be declared using the `release`
  argument. Otherwise, the function will return the most recent annotations
  from the [PANTHER][] website.
- Added `isURL()` check function.
- `readJSON()` adds support for JSON files. Like the other read functions, it
  supports both local files and remote URLs.

### ggplot2 themes

- `theme_midnight()` and `theme_paperwhite()` provide minimal, high contrast
  [ggplot2][] themes with bold sans serif labels.

### Major changes

- `loadData()` now supports `.rda`, `.rds`, and `.RData` files. The function
  will error by design if multiple data extensions are detected inside the
  directory specified with the `dir` argument.

### Minor changes

- Consolidated assert check function code.
- Moved assertive imports to `basejump-package.R` file.
- Consolidated globals inside package to `globals.R` file.
- Removed internal `.biocLite()` function. Now using `requireNamespace()`
  instead, without attempting to install automatically.
- Added internal support for safe loading RDS files.
- Switched back to using `message()`, `warning()`, and `stop()` instead of
  the [rlang][] equivalents.
- Improved internal method declaration using `getMethod()` where applicable.
- `multiassignAsEnvir()` is now recommended in place of
  `multiassignAsNewEnvir()`.
- `readFileByExtension()` will now attempt to use the [rio][] package for
  file extensions that are not natively supported.
- `writeCounts()` now uses `mapply()` internally.
- Migrated `assertFormalAnnotationCol()` to [bcbioBase][] package.


## basejump 0.4.0 (2018-03-22)

### Major changes

- Introducing new functions for the acquistion of gene and transcript
  annotations from [Ensembl][]: `ensembl()`, `genes()`, and `transcripts()`.
  These functions allow the return of `GRanges`, `DataFrame`, and `data.frame`
  class objects from [AnnotationHub][] using [ensembldb][].
- Improved internal `broadClass` definition code to match against chromosome
  from [Ensembl][] if available.
- `loadDataAsName()` now works with unquoted names, improving consistency
  with `loadData()` (non-standard evaluation).

### Minor changes

- Added new `convertUCSCBuildToEnsembl()` function, for easy remapping of
  [UCSC][] to [Ensembl][] genome build names (e.g. `hg38` to `GRCh38`).
- Migrated matrix methods for `plotCorrelationHeatmap()` here from
  [bcbioRNASeq][], for improved consistency with other heatmap functions.
- Exporting `makeNames()` variant of `base::make.names()` that sanitizes
  using underscores ("_") rather than dots (".").
- Converted `readYAML()` from a generic to standard function.
- Added support for [AppVeyor CI][] code testing on [Windows][].
- Made [Travis CI][] build checks stricter, adding support for `BiocCheck()`.
- Added new assert checks: `assertAreGeneAnnotations()`,
  `assertAreTranscriptAnnotations()`, `isAnImplicitInteger()`.
- Simplified working examples for assert checks to just show successes.

### Deprecations

- `annotable()` function has been deprecated in favor of the new `ensembl()`
  function.
- `checkAnnotable()` deprecated in favor of `assertIsAnnotable()`.
- `checkGene2symbol()` deprecated in favor of `assertIsGene2symbol()`.
- `checkTx2gene()` deprecated in favor of `assertIsTx2gene()`.
- `assertFormalColorFunction()` deprecated in favor of
  `assertIsHexColorFunctionOrNULL()`.
- `initializeDir()` deprecated in favor of `initializeDirectory()`.
- Defunct: `summarizeRows()`, `wash()`, `packageSE()`, `prepareSE()`,
  `metadataTable()`, `comp()`, `revcomp()`, `symbol2gene()`.


## basejump 0.3.1 (2018-02-19)

- Now exporting all assert checks in camel case instead of snake case, to
  match consistency in the rest of the package.
- Added `sanitizeColData()` function.
- Added `assertAllAreNonExisting()` function.
- Now exporting `midnightTheme()` as a `theme_midnight()` alias to match the
  syntax in the [ggplot2][] package.
- Added working examples and code coverage for all assert check functions.
- Simplified the internal collapse code for `annotable()` to simply work on
  the [Entrez][] identifier column (`entrez`). If a manually passed in data
  frame still has duplicates, the function will now abort instead of attempting
  to use `collapseToString()`.
- Added [ggplot2][] color palette assert checks:
  `assertColorScaleContinuousOrNULL()`, `assertColorScaleDiscreteOrNULL()`,
  `assertFillScaleContinuousOrNULL()`, `assertFillScaleDiscreteOrNULL()`.


## basejump 0.3.0 (2018-02-16)

- Switch to using [assertive][] internally for assert checks.
- Now exporting these assert check functions:
  `assert_formal_annotation_col()`, `assert_formal_color_function()`,
  `assert_formal_compress()`, `assert_formal_gene2symbol()`,
  `assert_formal_header_level()`, `assert_has_rownames()`,
  `assert_is_a_number_or_null()`, `assert_is_a_string_or_null()`,
  `assert_is_an_implicit_integer()`, `assert_is_an_implicit_integer_or_null()`
  `assert_is_an_integer_or_null()`, `assert_is_annotable()`,
  `assert_is_character_or_null()`, `assert_is_data.frame_or_null()`,
  `assert_is_gene2symbol()`, `assert_is_implicit_integer()`,
  `assert_is_implicit_integer_or_null()`, `assert_is_tx2gene()`,
  `has_rownames()`, `initializeDirectory()`, `is_implicit_integer()`.
- Renamed `md*()` functions to `markdown*()`.


## basejump 0.2.1 (2018-02-07)

- Added `convertGenesToSymbols()` and `convertTranscriptsToGenes()`
  functions. Previously some of this functionality was contained within the
  `gene2symbol()` and `tx2gene()` generics for the character method. This
  behavior was inconsistent with `gene2symbol()` and `tx2gene()` usage in the
  [bcbio][] R packages, so I decided to split these out into separate functions.
  Now `gene2symbol()` and `tx2gene()` work consistently with the `annotable()`
  function to return gene-to-symbol and transcript-to-gene identifier mappings
  in a `data.frame`.
- `markdownHeader()`, `markdownList()`, and `markdownPlotlist()` are now
  exported as S4 generics. The `md*()` function variants are now exported as
  aliases.
- `geomean()` has been renamed to `geometricMean()`.
- Miscellaneous improvements to error messages and warnings.


## basejump 0.2.0 (2018-01-28)

- Offloaded internal [bcbio][]-specific code to new package named [bcbioBase][].
  Consequently, this makes the [basejump][] package leaner, meaner, and easier
  to manage. The following functions are now exported in that package:
  `bcbio()`, `checkInterestingGroups()`, `flatFiles()`, `interestingGroups()`,
  `metrics()`, `plotDot()`, `plotGene()`, `plotQC()`, `plotViolin()`,
  `prepareSummarizedExperiment()`, `prepareTemplate()`, `readDataVersions()`,
  `readLogFile()`, `readProgramVersions()`, `readSampleMetadataFile()`,
  `sampleMetadata()`, `sampleYAML()`, `sampleYAMLMetadata()`,
  `sampleYAMLMetrics()`, and `selectSamples()`. These functions are now
  deprecated here in [basejump][] (see `deprecated.R` file for more
  information).
- `comp()` and `revcomp()` have been deprecated in favor of `complement()`
  and `reverseComplement()` from the [Biostrings][] package.
- Internally, errors, messages, and warnings now use methods from the
  [rlang][] package: `abort()`, `inform()`, and `warn()`, in place of `stop()`,
  `message()`, and `warning()`, respectively.
- Improved error handing for missing files in `loadData()`. Additionally, the
  file name must match the internal name in the RData file, otherwise
  `loadData()` will warn the user. This is more strict than the default
  behavior of `base::load()`, but helps prevent accidental overwrite in the
  current working environment.
- `localOrRemoteFile()`, previously an internal function, is now exported.
- `annotable()` now uses internal [GRCh37][] annotations from the [annotables][]
  package, which is saved in the `extdata/` directory internally. Previously,
  these genome annotations were accessed from lazy loaded data saved in the
  `data/` directory of the package repository.
- `annotables()` now checks for all packages attached by [ensembldb][] and
  [AnnotationHub][] and forces detachment at the end of the function call.
  Otherwise, this can result in the unwanted effect of [ensembldb][] masking
  other user-loaded functions, such as the [tidyverse][] suite (e.g.
  `dplyr::select()`).
- Consistently reformatted code indents to be a multple of 4 spaces, as
  recommended by [Bioconductor][].
- `camel()` now handles delimited numbers a little differently. Previously,
  delimiters in between numbers (e.g. the commas in "1,000,000") were stripped.
  Sometimes this can result in confusing names. For example, if we have a
  column formatted in dotted case containing a decimal (e.g. "resolution.1.6"),
  the decimal would be stripped (e.g. "resolution16" in camel). Now, we
  sanitize a numeric delimiter as a lower case "x" character (e.g.
  "resolution1x6"). This ensures that numbers containing decimals remain
  semantically meaningful when sanitized with `camel()`.
- Internally, `gsub()` (and `grepl()`) calls have been simplified to use the
  default order of "pattern, replacement, x".
- Internally, all implicit integers have been converted to explicit integers,
  where applicable.


## basejump 0.1.10 (2017-12-20)

- Bug fix for multiplexed sample input into `readSampleMetadataFile()`. We
  were detecting the presence of `index` column but should instead check
  against `sequence` column.
- Added `dynamicPlotlist()` and `mdPlotlist()` plotting utilities.
- Added `uniqueSymbols` parameter to `annotable()` function.


## basejump 0.1.9 (2017-12-18)

- Added `plotHeatmap()` functionality.
- Migrated `tpm()` generic from [bcbioRNASeq][], for future use in
  [bcbioSingleCell][].
- Added matrix method support for `plotHeatmap()`.
- Added matrix method support for `plotQuantileHeatmap()`, which works
  similarly as `plotHeatmap()`.


## basejump 0.1.8 (2017-12-14)

- Improved `matrix` and `dgCMatrix` method support in `aggregateReplicates()`
  and `aggregateFeatures()` functions. Both of these functions now use a
  consistent `groupings` parameter, which uses a named factor to define the
  mappings of either samples (columns) for `aggregateReplicates()` or
  genes/transcripts (rows) for `aggregateFeatures()`.
- Update for `makeNames` sanitization functions. Now they will work on
  `names(x)` for vectors by default.
- Improved `detectOrganism()` to match against "H. sapiens", etc.
- Added internal [GRCh37][] transcript to gene mapping.
- Improved organism matching to detect "Homo_sapiens" and "H. sapiens".
- Factors are now supported in the `makeNames` utilities: `camel()`,
  `dotted()`, `snake()`, and `upperCamel()`.
- Improved handling of `NA` values from [LibreOffice][] and
  [Microsoft Excel][Excel] output in `readFileByExtension()`. This function now
  sets `""`, `NA`, and `#N/A` strings as `NA` correctly.


## basejump 0.1.7 (2017-12-11)

- Renamed `fc2lr()` to `foldChangeToLogRatio()` and `lr2fc()` and
  `logRatioToFoldChange()`.
- Moved `plotDot()` and `plotViolin()` generics here from [bcbioSingleCell][].
- Added internal [GRCh37][] gene annotations.


## basejump 0.1.6 (2017-12-06)

- Moved `microplate()` code from the [wormbase][r-wormbase] package here, since
  it's of general interest.


## basejump 0.1.5 (2017-12-05)

- Added `checkAnnotable()`, `checkGene2symbol()`, `checkTx2gene()`, and
  `sanitizeAnnotable()` utility functions that will be used in the bcbio R
  packages.


## basejump 0.1.4 (2017-12-04)

- Added `midnightTheme()` [ggplot2][] theme. Originally this was defined as
  `darkTheme()` in the [bcbioSingleCell][] package, but can be useful for other
  plots and has been moved here for general bioinformatics usage. The theme now
  uses `ggplot2::theme_minimal()` as the base, with some color tweaks, namely
  dark gray axes without white axis lines.
- Improve NAMESPACE imports to include `stats::formula()` and
  `utils::capture.output()`.


## basejump 0.1.3 (2017-12-01)

- `loadData()` and `loadDataAsName()` now default to `replace = TRUE`. If an
  object with the same name exists in the destination environment, then a
  warning is generated.
- `collapseToString()` only attempts to dynamically return the original
  object class on objects that aren't class `data.frame`. I updated this code
  to behave more nicely with grouped tibbles (`grouped_df`), which are a
  virtual class of `data.frame` and therefore can't be coerced using
  `as(object, "grouped_df")`.
- DNA sequence utility functions `comp()` and `revcomp()` now return `NULL`
  for integers and numerics.
- For `prepareSummarizedExperiment()`, added support for dropping `NULL`
  objects in assays list. This is useful for handling output from
  [bcbioRNASeq][] when `transformLimit` is reached. In this case, the `rlog` and
  `vst` matrices aren't generated and set `NULL` in the assays list. Using
  `Filter(Negate(is.null), assays)` we can drop these `NULL` objects and
  prevent a downstream dimension mismatch in the
  `SummarizedExperiment::SummarizedExperiment()` call.
- Improved support for multiplexed files in `readSampleMetadataFile()`. This
  now checks for a sequence column containing ACGT nucleotides. When those are
  detected, the `revcomp` column is generated. Otherwise this step is skipped.
  This is useful for handling multiplexed sample metadata from 10X Genomics
  [Cell Ranger][] single-cell RNA-seq samples.
- Updated `annotable()` function to include nested [Entrez][] identifiers in the
  `entrez` column. This is useful for downstream functional analysis.


## basejump 0.1.2 (2017-11-30)

- Added [bcbio][] `plotQC()` generic.
- Added back `toStringUnique()` code, which is still in use in the
  [wormbase][r-wormbase] package.
- Added deprecations for `summarizeRows()` (now `collapseToString()`) and
  `wash()` functions.
- Updated installation method to include manual installation of [ensembldb][].
  Otherwise, [basejump][] installation fails due to [GenomeInfoDb][] and
  [GenomeInfoDbData][] not getting installed completely.
- Now suggesting that the user installs suggested packages in the README.
- Updated [PANTHER][] annotation scripts.
- Bug fix for `detectOrganism()`. Now allowing `NULL` return for unsupported
  organism, with a warning.


## basejump 0.1.1 (2017-11-11)

- Added overwrite support for `saveData()`. Now will skip on existing files
  when `overwrite = FALSE`.
- Bug fix for `readDataVersions()`, which shouldn't have the column types
  defined, using `col_types = "ccT"`.
- Improved key value pair method for `loadDataAsName()`. Now rather than
  using a named character vector for the `mappings` argument, the user can
  simply pass the key value pairs in as dots. For example, `newName1 =
  "oldName1", newName2 = "oldName2"`. The legacy `mappings` method will still
  work, as long as the dots argument is a length of 1.
- [Ensembl][] release version now defaults to `NULL` instead of `current` for
  `annotable()`, `gene2symbol()`, `symbol2gene()` and `tx2gene()` functions.
- Allow `rowData` to be left unset in `prepareSummarizedExperiment()`. This is
  useful for setting up objects that don't contain gene annotations.
- Removed sample selection by pattern matching (`pattern`, `patternCol`
  arguments) in `readSampleMetadata()`. This feature wasn't fully baked and
  doesn't offer enough functionality to the user.


## basejump 0.1.0 (2017-10-23)

- Bump version to match [bcbioRNASeq][] package.
- Improved unit testing coverage of `prepareSummarizedExperiment()`.
- Added quiet mode support to functions that output messages, where applicable.
- Consolidated [roxygen2][] function imports to `basejump-package.R` file.
- Deprecated `sampleDirs()` generic.
- Improved organism detection in `detectOrganism()` and added support for
  chicken genome.
- Clarified warning messages in `prepareSummarizedExperiment()` to make
  sample loading with `loadRNASeq()` and `loadSingleCell()` in the [bcbio][]
  packages less confusing.
- Improved `NULL` returns in `readDataVersions`, `readLogFile()`, and
  `readProgramVersions()` utility functions.
- Fixed export of `*GTF()` alias functions to simply wrap the `*GFF()`
  functions with S4 methods support.
- Improved lane split technical replicate handling in
  `readSampleMetadataFile()`.
- Improved `camel()` syntax for both lax and strict modes. Added
  `upperCamel()` function.
- Switched `str_()` to base `grep()` and `gsub()` in internal functions.


## basejump 0.0.25 (2017-10-13)

- Improved consistency of `setMethod()` calls using `signature()`.
- Converted `loadRemoteData()` to a standard function instead of using S4
  dispatch, allowing the `envir` argument to be set properly.


## basejump 0.0.24 (2017-10-10)

- Added additional package version requirements in `DESCRIPTION` file.
- Implicit integers are allowed.
- Using [GitHub][] version of [covr][] package for unit tests.
- Renamed `multiassignAsNewEnv()` to `multiassignAsNewEnvir()`
- Added `*GFF()` function variants for `gene2symbolFromGTF()` and
  `tx2geneFromGTF()`.
- Added shared [bcbio][] generic functions: `aggregateReplicates()`, `bcbio()`,
  `bcbio<-()`, `interestingGroups()`, `metrics()`, `plotGene()`,
  `sampleDirs()`, `sampleMetadata()`, `selectSamples()`. These functions are
  saved in `bcbioGenerics.R` file.
- Incorporated [bcbio][] utility functions shared across [bcbioRNASeq][] and
  [bcbioSingleCell][]: `readDataVersions()` (deprecated `.dataVersions()`),
  `readLogFile()` (deprecated `.logFile()`), `readProgramVersions()`
  (deprecated `.programs()`), `sampleYAML()` (deprecated `.sampleYAML()`),
  `sampleYAMLMetadata()` (deprecated `sampleYAMLMetadata()`),
  `sampleYAMLMetrics()` (deprecated .sampleYAMLMetrics()`).
- Deprecated `metadataTable()` function.
- Moved all [roxygen2][] documentation to `methods-*.R` files where applicable.
- Now using `assays` in `prepareSummarizedExperiment()` generic definition as
  primary object.
- Improved `assignAndSaveData()` to add silent return of file path.
- Now consistently using clear function definitions (`()`) in chain
  operations with magrittr pipe (`%>%`).
- Added `.prepareSampleMetadata()` utility function, for use with loading
  sample metadata from an external CSV, [Excel][], or YAML file.
- Added `loadData()` functionality back to the package.
- Initial commit of `loadDataAsName()` function.
- Improved `annotable()` function documentation and support for [Ensembl][]
  release versions.
- Improved sanitization rules for `camel()`, `dotted()`, and `snake()` name
  functions. Added the `strict` argument to `camel()` and `dotted()`.
- Improved the documentation for the `makeNames` functions, by splitting each
  into their own separate methods file.
- Improved S4 method support for the logRatio functions.
- Added integer support for `geomean()` function. Also improved internal code
  of `geomean()` based on Paul McMurdie's Stack Overflow post. See function
  documentation for more information.
- Added release support for `tx2gene` functions.
- Reduced the number of reexported functions (for documentation) down to the
  [magrittr][] pipe (`%>%`), `Matrix()`, `DataFrame()`, and `tibble()`.
- Added silent return of file path to `saveData()` function.
- Improved documentation for [tibble][] coercion using `as(object, "tibble")`
- Renamed `collapse()` function to `collapseToString()`, to avoid NAMESPACE
  collisions with tidyverse packages ([dplyr][], [glue][]).
